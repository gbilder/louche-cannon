After my trash-talk about &#8220;uber-geeks&#8221;, [Leigh Dodds][1] picked up the &#8220;[Subscribe To My Brain][2]&#8221; challenge and produced [this][3] within hours. He even produced a button, which -as everybody knows- automatically turns beta software into a production service&#8230;

It turns out that [Phil Wilson][4], was working on a similar concept and [Danny Ayers][5] was thinking along the same lines.

And I am happy to say that the phrase &#8220;subscribe to my brain&#8221; seems to have turned into a mini-meme (Play Austin Powers theme tune here, start maniacally laughing).

I promised to subscribe to the brain of whoever wrote the requested service, but the problem is I already subscribe to Leigh&#8217;s brain- so the only reward I can offer him is a tin of French sweets sporting an appropriate name:

<a href="http://www.gbilder.com/blog/wp-content/Picture(5).jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.gbilder.com/blog/wp-content/Picture(5).jpg','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.gbilder.com/blog/wp-content/Picture(5)-tm.jpg" height="100" width="133" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Picture(5)" /></a><span style="font-size:12pt;"></p> 

<p>
  </span>Oh, yeah- and I added a &#8220;brain button&#8221; (amongst others) to this site.
