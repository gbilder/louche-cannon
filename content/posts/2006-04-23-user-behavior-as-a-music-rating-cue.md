The &#8220;My Rating&#8221; feature on iTunes has always felt a little clumsy. First of all, I hardly ever listen to music on iTunes itself- I listen to most of my music on my iPod. Secondly, I don&#8217;t want to have to \*do\* anything convoluted or extra in order to register that I like or dislike a song. I am surprised that Apple, given its user interface prowess, hasn&#8217;t managed to take better advantage of natural user behavior in order to more effectively drive the ratings system. In short:

  * If I play a song multiple times in a row, it probably means I like it. Increment the rating.
  * When I repeatedly turn up the volume on a song- it probably means I like it. Increment the rating.
  * When I repeatedly skip a song, I probably don&#8217;t like it. Decrement the rating.

I have taken to quoting Bradely Horowitz&#8217;s [observation][1] that &#8220;<span style="font-size:13pt;">the act of consumption is itself an act of creation&#8221;. The iTunes/iPod UI team should be well positioned to exploit this phenomena. </span>
