In the early days of the web, buzzword coinage relied on prefixes. Add an &#8220;e&#8221; or an &#8220;i&#8221; to any word or phrase and you had yourself a brand new business to flog.

i-widgets
  
e-grommits

A few years later- the infix became the basis for the buzz-worthy. The numeral &#8220;2&#8221; became _de rigueur_.

b2b
  
fan2team
  
farmer2market
  
dog2vomit

And now it is the turn of the suffix and again it is numeric.
