I hated it in Pascal and I hate it now in del.icio.us. This might even force me to stop using del.icio.us.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/200702271138.jpg" onclick="window.open('/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/200702271138.jpg','popup','width=812,height=381,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/200702271138-tm.jpg" height="100" width="213" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="200702271138" /></a>

Of course, it isn&#8217;t the number that I really hate- its the programmers who, rather than think of the realistic use cases for a column called &#8220;notes&#8221;, just settle for the default &#8220;biggish computer number&#8221; that pops into their head. You&#8217;d think they would have at least upgraded to 512 or 1024 by now.

Grump.
